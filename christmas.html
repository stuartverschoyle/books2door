Streaker is no ordinary dog. She's a rocket on four legs with a woof attached, and Trevor has got until the end of the holidays to train her.

These books are helpful for developing young children and their reading skills. They prompt children to consider their own emotions, those of others, to question reality and ‘make-believe’ while introducing them to all kinds of new characters that they may see elsewhere in other books. Each story explains a moral or social value that can be explained to children, including kindness, inclusion and friendship that can be applied to their own way of thinking as they grow up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese retellings of old folk tales are a great introduction for children into reading.

There are plenty of options based on different animals too, which will be an appeal to all children, even the big bad wolf! And who doesn’t want to see the fun that gingerbread man or big pancake can bring? That’s not all. Dwarves and elves will form fantastic friendships while the prince and princess narratives will be guaranteed favourites for everyone.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLadybird has brought people together with special books and words that are especially meaningful for children, it encourages learning, and exciting exploration of books.

Now, all of the best-loved titles from the classic Well Loved Tales series, written by Vera Southgate, are being re-presented to a modern audience in this great Ladybird Tales box set. These books are perfect for reading aloud, or for older, more confident readers to read by themselves. There are 24 Ladybird Tales in this set, so the only problem is which one to read first!

Some classic titles might stand out to you from previous reading with a sibling, your own childhood or you’ve had your eye on it in the library. It’s also very likely that these classics are being used in primary schools so they could be on your child’s reading list.

These books are helpful for developing young children and their reading skills. They prompt children to consider their own emotions, those of others, to question reality and ‘make-believe’ while introducing them to all kinds of new characters that they may see elsewhere in other books. Each story explains a moral or social value that can be explained to children, including kindness, inclusion and friendship that can be applied to their own way of thinking as they grow up.\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eThese retellings of old folk tales are a great introduction for children into reading. When it comes to introducing fictional characters such as beasts or giants, these books are a go-to for all parents, as they are presented in such a way as not to frighten children but rather leave them intrigued and wanting to find out more. There are plenty of options based on different animals too, which will be an appeal to all children, even the big bad wolf! And who doesn’t want to see the fun that gingerbread man or big pancake can bring? That’s not all. Dwarves and elves will form fantastic friendships while the prince and princess narratives will be guaranteed favourites for everyone.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003eLadybird has brought people together with special books and words that are especially meaningful for children, it encourages learning, and exciting exploration of books.

(Her big sister goes and won’t stop going on about it). But when Mira arrives on her first day all the unicorns are gone . . . except Dave! Dave isn’t quite the sparkly magical unicorn Mira was expecting to find at the end of the rainbow – he’s more grumpy than glittery, more interested in lunch than magical quests and he always runs off when Mira tries to ride him – but Mira’s not going to let that get her down. Along with her new friends and their (much more glittery) unicorns, she is determined to be the best at Quests and protect the special unicorn world! For all fans of The Worst Witch, The Magic Unicorn Society, My Little Pony, Pamela Butchart - and for anyone looking for the perfect unicorn gift for girls and boys!

In Maisy Goes on Holiday, Maisy enjoys packing her suitcase, then meeting Cyril at a busy station and catching a train to the seaside. They have lots of fun on the beach and at the café, write postcards to their friends and finally sleep a peaceful night at their hotel (after bouncing on the beds, of course).\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaisy Christmas Eve\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eIt's Christmas Eve, hooray!

She must pack her sleeping bag, her pyjamas and – oh! let's not forget Panda! Lala is there, too, and together they dance, talk and play all day. They even have a special sleepover supper! Maisy never knew sleepovers could be so fun!\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaisy Goes to the Library (Maisy)\u003c\/strong\u003e\u003cbr\u003eWhen Maisy goes to the library it seems like the perfect place to read her sparkly story.

But they soon find that pitching a tent is not an easy thing to do. Even if they do manage to keep the tent up, there’s the matter of fitting them all in — Maisy, Charley, Cyril, Tallulah, and finally, the huge elephant, Eddie. What a squeezy squish-squash!

Maisy and Charley are in the city visiting their friend Dotty, and there are many things to get used to - noisy traffic, enormous buildings, and sidewalks so crowded they have to walk very slowly (all the better for looking in store windows). Riding the escalator and elevator - and hanging on tight in the subway - are almost as much fun as exploring the giant toy store and eating pizza in a cafe.

Maisy and her friends are off to the cinema to see the latest adventure movie: Hero in the Jungle. Eddie's most favourite movie star (ever), Troy T. Tiger, is starring and – ooh! – he can barely contain his excitement! In fact, he gets so excited that he shouts at the screen. Shhhhhhh... Don't you know you can't shout in the cinema, Eddie? Seating arrangements, the dark cinema, popcorn spills and a nail-biting hiding-behind-your-hands moment ... this is everything a first cinema trip is about! It's more fun with Maisy!

In Maisy Goes on Holiday, Maisy enjoys packing her suitcase, then meeting Cyril at a busy station and catching a train to the seaside. They have lots of fun on the beach and at the caf, write postcards to their friends and finally sleep a peaceful night at their hotel (after bouncing on the beds, of course). \u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003eMaisy Goes to Hospital\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003eMaisy has broken her leg playing on the trampoline, and now she's in hospital for the night.

They are met at the coach station by their friend Dotty, who shows them around... What noisy traffic! What giant buildings! So many flashing lights! And everywhere is so crowded even the park. As Maisy and Charley explore, they go down into the underground, up an escalator in a department store where for a moment Maisy even gets a bit lost and see all the colourful sights in the wonderful bustling city.\u003c\/p\u003e\n\u003cp\u003e\u003cstrong\u003e\u003cspan data-mce-fragment=\"1\"\u003eMaisy \u003c\/span\u003eGoes on a Sleepover\u003cbr\u003e\u003c\/strong\u003eMaisy has been invited to her very first sleepover at Tallulah's house how exciting!

Inspired by this idea, he led peaceful protests to free India from British rule and unite the country – ending violence and unfair treatment. His bravery and free-thinking made him one of the most iconic people of peace in the world, known as Mahatma, meaning 'great soul'.

<p>Christmas is a time where you look back and remember times past. It’s the perfect season to crack open some <a href="https://www.books2door.com/collections/classic-childrens-books" data-mce-href="https://www.books2door.com/collections/classic-childrens-books" data-mce-fragment="1">classic children’s books</a>. We’ve got favourites from <em>Black Beauty</em> to <em>A Christmas Carol</em>, with many available as instant collection boxed sets. Classics are also a fixture of many of our <a href="https://www.books2door.com/collections/reading-libraries" data-mce-href="https://www.books2door.com/collections/reading-libraries" data-mce-fragment="1">reading libraries</a>. These well-loved stories have been revised in order to suit a reading scheme that will bring your child from phonics to independent reading. There are also some great board book libraries for younger readers, so every member of the family can have their own.</p>
<p>After everyone has tucked into Christmas dinner, there’s nothing for it but a <a href="https://www.books2door.com/collections/netflix-binge" data-mce-href="https://www.books2door.com/collections/netflix-binge" data-mce-fragment="1">Netflix binge</a> to relax. But we’ve got an even better idea! We’ve gathered together the books behind the hit shows so that you can get ahead on <em><a href="https://www.books2door.com/products/bridgerton-family-series-5-books-collection-set-by-julia-quinn-paperback-young-adult" data-mce-href="https://www.books2door.com/products/bridgerton-family-series-5-books-collection-set-by-julia-quinn-paperback-young-adult" data-mce-fragment="1">Bridgerton</a></em> and <em><a href="https://www.books2door.com/products/the-witcher-series-8-books-fantasy-paperback-andrzej-sapkowski" data-mce-href="https://www.books2door.com/products/the-witcher-series-8-books-fantasy-paperback-andrzej-sapkowski" data-mce-fragment="1">The Witcher</a></em>. However, if your mind’s on your next meal instead, take a look at our selection of <a href="https://www.books2door.com/collections/cookbooks" data-mce-href="https://www.books2door.com/collections/cookbooks" data-mce-fragment="1">cookbooks</a>. It features many of the world’s cuisines, and there’s a book for every skill level. Bounce into the new year with a new set of recipes to try - you may encounter some new favourites.</p>
